# David Forrest Tucker - Professional Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills in full-stack development, data architecture, and interactive web applications. The site is built with a focus on modularity, modern JavaScript, and a clean, responsive user interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Dynamic Theme Toggle:** A sleek light/dark mode theme switcher that uses CSS variables for seamless transitions.
*   **Interactive Project Demos:** The portfolio includes several live, interactive demos to showcase applied skills:
    *   **Public Health Tracker:** An interactive dashboard that fetches, processes, and displays public health data using Chart.js. It demonstrates asynchronous data handling, API interaction, and dynamic component rendering.
    *   **Aphasia Category Judgement Survey:** A functional cognitive assessment tool built with SurveyJS, featuring custom navigation, timed events, and dynamic feedback based on user responses.
    *   **A* Pathfinding Visualizer:** A from-scratch implementation of the A* search algorithm, allowing users to draw obstacles and visualize the pathfinding process in real-time.
*   **Modular JavaScript Architecture:** The codebase is organized into ES6 modules, promoting separation of concerns and making the code clean, reusable, and easy to maintain.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Methodologies

### Front-End
*   **HTML5:** Semantic and accessible markup.
*   **CSS3:** Modern styling with Custom Properties (variables) for theming and a responsive, mobile-first approach.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Modular, object-oriented code for all dynamic functionality.

### Core Libraries
*   **SurveyJS:** For building the interactive cognitive assessment survey.
*   **Chart.js:** For creating the dynamic charts in the health tracker.
*   **Font Awesome:** For iconography.

### Development & Design
*   **From Prototype to Production:** The project began with a template from Webflow, which provided the initial design and layout.
*   **Custom Architecture:** The original Webflow export was then significantly refactored into a modular, hand-coded architecture. This was done to implement complex, custom features (like the interactive demos), improve maintainability, and showcase best practices in modern front-end development.
